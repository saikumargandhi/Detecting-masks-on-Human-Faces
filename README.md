# Detecting-masks-on-Human-Faces

The goal is to detect whether a person has wore the mask or not by using Tensorflow, Keras, CNN.

<b>train_model.py</b> - is the training code written in Python by using Tensorflow, Keras, CNN for training the model.

Training, Validation Accuracy and Loss image shows the respective accuracies and losses occured while training the model for 10 epochs.

<b>Requirements</b> : numpy , matplotlib, keras, tensorflow, os

If you want to train your model from scracth run the train_model.py and adjust the epochs of your choice. Just make sure that the dataset and train_model.py are in the same folder.
